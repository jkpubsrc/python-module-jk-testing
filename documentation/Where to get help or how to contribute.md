I found a bug. How can I report it?
-----------------------------------

Bug reports are always welcome. In order to file a bug report please log in at GitHub and then go to https://github.com/jkpubsrc/python-module-jk-testing/issues and open a new issue.

Please have in mind that authors of any kind of software need to be able to reproduce the bug. Otherwise it is not possible at all to fix it. Consider providing the following information as it might be useful:

* Your operating system and exact operating system version (e.g. by executing `lsb_release -a`)
* Your python version (e.g. by executing `python3 --version`)
* A description in what situations the bug occurs
* A description what you think that should happen
* A description of what has happened instead (= the bug)
* You might want to consider providing a small code snipplet in the issue you create an GitHub which demonstrates the bug.
* Try to judge if this is a severe bug or not: Is it of general nature? Is it bound to very specific situations? Does it need to be fixed extremly fast or is it enough if it is fixed in the next week?

But please remember to tag your issue with `Bug` in that case.

Request more features
---------------------

You might find this piece of software quite useful but maybe you're missing a specific feature. Or you might have usecase this piece of software would fit perfectly, if a few minor changes would be made. As it is the goal to adapt to user's needs feel free to either ...

* contact the author(s) directly by EMail - preferrably pubsrc@binary-overflow.de - or ...
* create an issue on https://github.com/jkpubsrc/python-module-jk-testing/issues instead.

Of course the last option is the preferred option. But please remember to tag your issue with `FeatureRequest` in that case.

Contribute and add features yourself
------------------------------------

If you like to contribute to the project and add new features yourself you're perfectly welcome to do so. In that ase please write an EMail to the following EMail address:

* pubsrc@binary-overflow.de
